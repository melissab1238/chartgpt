# ChartGPT
ChartGPT is a simple visualization tool that combines Plotly's graphing abilities and OpenAI's code generation abilities to visualize your data.

## Steps
1. Create an OpenAI account and [copy your API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Upload a CSV of your data. Check out out [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv) for many public datasets.

`That's it.`

ChartGPT produces your visualization using Plotly's API so you can see your results right away. Further, you can copy the code and build to your heart's content.
